/* ARGUMENT -> Values that are passed in funciton call and 
used to send value 
and is known as actuall parameter

Parameter-> Values in funtion declaration and definition 
and used to receive value 
and are known as formal parameters

Changes to parameter in funtions don't change the value in calling funtion

because a copy of argument in passed in the function
